## Questions Before Building

1. **Domain:** Is crystaldeodorantprotection.com already purchased?

   - Should I use placeholder images or do you have product photos?
   - Can I reference/hotlink images from purrify.ca or create similar ones?

3. **Page 4:** Include the optional /crystal-litter-guide page? (Adds SEO value)

4. **Email Capture:** Skip entirely, or add simple Formspree form?

5. **Color Confirmation:** The teal (#b6e3f4) matches purrify.ca - should I match exactly or create a complementary palette?

6. **Legal:**
